Iam Laxmi Naga Pravahlika  Kurapati  pursuing  Masters in Computer  Science  in
SUNY  New  Paltz , New York. I would  like to specify my Academic Qualification
Which I completed in India during (2015-2019). I completed my Bachelor Of  Engg
in Computer Science From Osmania University, Hyderabad, India. The subjects that
we learned during the course are Data Structures ,Data Mining ,Artificial Intelligence
, Compiler Construction , Computer Networks ,Embedded  Systems ,Automata, Theory
Computation ,Web programming  and services ,Data Communications.
During the fifth semester, We had a  Lab session for Web programming and services 
Where we had to complete building of some websites using HTML, CSS and javascript.
I had a good experience learning and practicing how to build dynamic and static web-
Pages during the entire semester. For a mini project I worked on building a website for
Fundraising using BOOTSTRAP.


I strongly believe that Iâ€™ll be able to understand complex concepts and excel as a good
Web developer during this course. Iam currently working on basic concepts which help
me during the projects and in the future. Iam willing to work hard on learning Javascript 
and nodejs more during this semester. I have a good idea on how to use HTML, CSS 
 should concentrate more on how to build applications using these  languages in more 
 effective way. 
 Thank you.
